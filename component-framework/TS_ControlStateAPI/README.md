# Power Apps component framework: Control state API component

This sample component shows how the ability to build components that can maintain user state throughout the user's session as the user navigates to and from the component.

## Before you can try the sample components

To try the sample components, you must first:

1. Install [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (comes with npm). We recommend LTS (Long Term Support) version 12.16.1 LTS because it seems to be the most stable.

1. Install [.NET Framework 4.6.2 Developer Pack](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462). 

1. If you donâ€™t already have Visual Studio 2017 or later, follow one of these options:
   - Option 1: Install [Visual Studio 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2017) or later.
   - Option 2: Install [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) and then install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

1. Install [Microsoft Power Apps CLI](https://aka.ms/PowerAppsCLI).
1. [Download](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/component-framework) the sample components so that you have a local copy.

## What this sample does

The Power Apps component framework allows you to persist state of component across multiple renderings of the component within the same session. It provides you with the ability to build components that can maintain user state throughout the user's session as the user navigates to and from the component.

For example, if your code component is a long list that the user can scroll through, you could leverage the `SetControlState` functionality to remember the point in the list the user is looking at when they navigated away from the form. You could then add logic on component initialization to check the stored state and render the component's list at the point where the user was previously reading.

## How to run the sample

See [How to run the sample components](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/component-framework/README.md) for more information about how to build and import components into Common Data Service.
