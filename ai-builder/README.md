# AI Builder Samples

This topic provides information about the sample data files available in the **ai-builder** folder.

AI Builder documentation is available here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/ai-builder>

## Sample data for prediction

To help you get started quickly with prediction, use these three sample datasets. For information on how to import the sample data and use it in a prediction model, see [Data Preparation](https://docs.microsoft.com/ai-builder/prediction-data-prep) in AI Builder docs.

Please note that you do not need to download the CSV files, but rather link the raw URL of the CSV files during the data import flow.

### Online Shopper Intention

This dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The prediction scenario is whether a customer will make a purchase using web analytics data from an online retailer.
